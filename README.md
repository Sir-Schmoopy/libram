Making use of the numbered lists for random results:
Different from the bulleted listings that are designed for selective choice based on criteria or as reference, numbered lists are useful when choosing an entry or rolling randomly.
When using tables, my preference is a 50/50 split between rolling and specifically choosing what I believe will work best for my current objective. Which sometimes means rolling repeatedly until I get a result to my liking.
If you are rolling on the various numbered tables, you will notice some are not of convenient lengths for standard die rolls, but there are options.
Use your standard d4, d6 or d10, and a d10, and the charts below:

I still have to make a dice roller script that can be used here. But also you will just be able to get random items from the list, no dice rolls needed, ideally!

30 item list
D6 for a 1 – 30 list
1 or 2 = 10 + d10 at face value
3 or 4 = 20 + d10 at face value
5 or 6 = 00 at face value, but a result of 5 or 6 + 0 on the d10 = 30

40 item list
D4 for a 1 – 40 list 1 = 10 + d10 at face 2 = 20 + d10 at face 3 = 30 + d10 at face 4 = 00 + d10 at face

50 item list
D10 for a 1 – 50 list
1 or 2 = 10 + d10 at
3 or 4 = 20 + d10 at
5 or 6 = 30 + d10 at
7 or 8 = 40 + d10 at
9 or 0 = 00 at face value, but a result of 9 or 0 + 0 on the d10 = 50
