# Hey, Buddy!

## This whole thing is meant as an exercise in Ruby and hopefully it'll become a genuinely useful thing for DMing on-the-fly content

This project has a lot of lists from the `Libram of Lists` kickstarter and some other content I added because I thought it would be fun to include.

Right now it only functions as a CLI way of generating random content as needed, which isn't great. But the hope is to make a site that'll be useful for this stuff.

When using tables and lists, my preference is a 50/50 split between rolling and specifically choosing what I believe will work best for my current objective. Which sometimes means rolling repeatedly until I get a result to my liking.

You can navigate to the tables if you want to be choosy, but right now you can use the `engine.rb` to roll most of what you might need in a (hopefully) quicker fashion.

use 'plz' in the command line to get instant outputs.
